                <h1>THE BEAGLE</h1>
                <P>The Beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle
                    is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With a great sense of smell and superior tracking
                    instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs
                    in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due
                    to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.</P>
                <p>The beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards as "merry", they
                    are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on the individual. They
                    enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over.</p>
                <h3>Did you know...??</h3>
                <p>Former US President Lyndon Baines Johnson had two beagles, and caused an outcry when he picked up one of
                    them by its ears during an official greeting on the White House lawn.</p>

                    Beagles or miniature Beagles, it wasn't until later that these tiny dogs were bred into the larger hunting
                    hounds we known today.</p>
